## Autonomous forklift clamp control module

**Autonomous Clamp control involves the use of the following:**

 - Simulated clamp-forklift switches
 - Limit switches
 - Force sensitive resistors (FSR)
 - Stretch sensors
 - Integration the overall clamp simulation using Arduino through ROS.

 - Check the video for the simulation of the clamp control done using a Logitech joystick controller.
